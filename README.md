## Make a structured interview

Make a script (questions and directions) or use our script templates in Typeform and invite multiple interviewees, influencers, community, fans, reportsers, internal comms, behind the scenes, broadcast to get interviewed by Storypop bot.

## Storypop interviews your interviewees

Your interviewee gets interviewed by the Messenger StoryBot and captures authentic video answers herself with directions from the bot and lets you know when you're interview is ready.

## Download the video & audio interview files

Storybot collects all the video answers and puts it structured in your Dropbox folder where you can curate and download all the video footages.
