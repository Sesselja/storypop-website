# FAQ

## How does the Storypop bot work?
1. Register and log into Storypop.
2. Optionally, you can connect your Dropbox account if you want the content to be uploaded to a Dropbox folder.
3. Make scripts (question sets and directions) in Storypop.
4. Copy/Paste an invite link from Storypop and send it to your interviewees.
5. Your interviewees click the link and record the video/audio interview themselves with the pre-set question and directions from the Storypop bot on their time in [Facebook Messenger](https://messenger.com) or [Workplace chat](https://www.facebook.com/workplace/chat-app?path=chat-app).
6. All of the videos collected from the interview will be automatically available on your Storypop dashboard and posted to your Dropbox folder (if you connected Dropbox).

## How do I make scripts/question sets in Storypop?

Click the **+ New script** button on your dashboard to be taken to the script editor. A script is a set of questions to ask your interviewees. You can give your script a title, category, and make it private or public.

For each script, you can add as many questions as you like using the **Add question** button. Questions can be of several different types:

- To make your interviewee accept legal terms before the interview can proceed, select the **Agree to terms** type.
- To create a simple question asking for a video, audio, photo or text answer from the user, select the **Question** type.
- To simply show a message to the interviewee without prompting an answer (such as an introduction, instructions pertaining to the following questions, or thank you message at the end of the interview), use the **Statement** type.
- To make the interviewee upload B-roll footage (extra footage captured to enrich the story you're telling and to have greater flexibility when editing), use the **B-roll footage** type.
- To ask for the user's **E-mail address**, **Phone number** or **Location**, use the respective types (this lets Facebook Messenger provide quick replies for convenience).
- To ask a simple yes or no question, use the **Yes/no question** type.

Each question can include a description, which can be used to provide instructions or a demo (link) of what you're looking for in a given video shot, and/or any number of photo, video, gif or link attachments.

## Why Facebook Messenger?
[Facebook Messenger](https://messenger.com) is an instant messaging software that is used by more than a billion people. Facebook Messenger is used to interview the interviewee with the help of the Storypop bot. The interviewee uploads all content herself. The benefit of using Messenger to interview people is that most people already have the app installed on their phone and know how to use it. They don’t have to download a special app to be able to take an interview or participate in a campaign.

## How do my interviewees upload content into Facebook Messenger or Workplace chat?
Your interviewees can use Facebook/Workplace Messenger apps on their phone or on desktop. Storypop supports videos, photos, audio and gif files uploaded to Facebook Messenger. 
- They can record videos (15 sec) and edit them, audio (1 min) or take photos inside Facebook Messenger. Videos can be edited within the Messenger Camera.
- They can upload longer videos and photos from any app inside Messenger.
- They can upload multiple videos, photos, gifs, or audio clips for each question.
- Interviewees can write “Skip” in Storypop’s Messenger bot to skip a question or “Restart” to start the interview from the beginning. 
They can press a button to delete an answer they've already submitted (e.g. video) completely, or delete it and replace it with another answer. It will automatically be deleted/replaced in the interviewer’s Storypop dashboard and Dropbox folder (if the interviewer connected Dropbox).

All of the content can be viewed, curated and downloaded within Storypop.
