## How does the Storypop bot work?
1. Register and log into Storypop. Be sure to have a [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) account.

4. Copy/Paste an invite link from Storypop and send it to your interviewees.

## How do I make scripts/questions sets in Storypop?

Make a Script. A script is a script/question set with multiple question to ask your interviewees. 
You can include photos, gifs and link to Youtube and Vimeo to display with each question.
1. To make a introduction text to display in the beginning of the interview displayed by Storypop in Messenger **use block: Welcome Screen**
2. To make questions for Storypop to get video, audio, photo or gif answers **use block: Question**
3. To make your interviewee accept legal terms of the interview that the interviewee can accept or not accept **use block: Accept terms**. We recommend having a link to your terms hosted on another website rather than displaying the whole text in the bot.
4. To make a statement or direction for Storypop to display in the Messenger interview without prompting an answer from your interviewee **use block: Statement**
5. To make your interviewee upload B-roll footage (extra footage captured to enrich the story you're telling and to have greater flexibility when editing) **use block: File Upload**
6. To make a final statement in the end and for example thank your interviewee for taking the interview or you have some extra information to share **use block: Thank you screen**
7. For each block you can:
  a. Add a **description** under your question that will also be displayed by the Storypop bot. You can use it to show a demo (e.g. a link) of what you’re looking for in this particular video shot.
  b. Add a photo, gif or link from Youtube/Vimeo with your question that will be displayed in the interview taken by Storypop bot in Messenger.

## Why Facebook Messenger?
[Facebook Messenger](https://messenger.com) is an instant messaging software that is used by more than a billion people. Facebook Messenger is used to interview the interviewee with the help of the Storypop bot. The interviewee uploads all content herself. The benefit of using Messenger to interview people is that most people already have the app installed on their phone and know how to use it. They don’t have to download a special app to be able to take an interview or participate in a campaign.

## How do my interviewees upload content into Facebook Messenger?
Your interviewees can use Facebook Messenger apps on their phone or on desktop. Storypop supports videos, photos, audio and gif files upload to Facebook Messenger. 
- They can record videos (15 sec) and edit them, audio (1 min) or take photos inside Facebook Messenger. Videos can be edited within the Messenger Camera.
- They can upload longer videos and photos from any app inside Messenger.
- They can upload multiple videos, photos, gifs, or audio clips for each question.
- Interviewees can write “Skip” in Storypop’s Messenger bot to skip a question or “Restart” to start the interview from the beginning. 
They can press a button to delete an answer they've already submitted (e.g. video) completely, or delete it and replace it with another answer. It will automatically be deleted/replaced in the interviewer’s Dropbox folder.

## What’s Dropbox?
[Dropbox](https://dropbox.com) is a cloud-based file syncing service. Storypop uses Dropbox to collect answers (videos, photos, audio, gifs) from your interviewee. Dropbox is free for up to 2 GB of storage, but the space can be expanded for up to $17/mo.

## Where will the content uploaded from my interviewees be placed in Dropbox?
All content taken with the Storypop interview bot will be automatically placed in your Dropbox Account under the Apps/Storypop folder. Within this folder, each typeform/interview will have its own folder, and within the interview folder, each interviewee has a folder with their answers.

All of the content can be viewed, curated and downloaded on Dropbox.com or in the Dropbox folder on your computer.
